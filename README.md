## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a coding quiz using primarily JavaScript.

As anyone can see this project is not done. 

I believe that I had a very good start for my code, but I ran out of time to complete the project. This is due to a bad patch with one of my mental disabilites (not an excuse, just the reason). I plan to continue to work on it at a later date even if it will not improve my grade, so that it can be at least semi-functional.
